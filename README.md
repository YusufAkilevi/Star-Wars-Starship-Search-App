- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript
- React.js

- Router

### What I learned

I learned about components, props, state, and how to manage stateful data within a React application. While creating routes with router, I learned how to use React Router to handle client-side routing within a single-page application. I learned how to define routes, handle navigation, and pass parameters between routes. While fetching data with axios,I learned how to use Axios to make HTTP requests from within a React application. I learned how to handle responses, error states, and asynchronous behavior. Through API Integration, I learned how to integrate with an external API to fetch data and display it within a React application. I learned about data modeling, parsing responses, and handling errors. Also, I gained experience with styling a React application using CSS. I learned how to use CSS classes, selectors, and styling rules to create a consistent look and feel across the application.

Overall, this project helped me build my skills with React.js, React Router, and Axios, as well as giving me experience with integrating with an external API and styling a React application.
